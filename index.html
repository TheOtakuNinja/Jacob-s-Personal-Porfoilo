<h3 id="about">A Little About Me </h3>
<p>I was born in North Carolina.I'm a little skinny Laos and Mien kid who is a freash man in oakland high school now in 2019. I love tech and you'd learn more below. I have few friends but that's all I need because I don't talk as much as others outside but inside I'm a differnt person while playing game, like yelling, talking about anything really I'm down to life telling about every bit that made me happy and everything that I hate or just made me sad. I'm a weird person but being weird made me good friends with people I'd probably never have met if I wasn't and they're one of the best people I met because I feel safe to tell them things I'd normally keep to myself</p>

<h3 id="about">What I love about tech</h3>
<p>I love tech, so much that I can barely live without it. In this day of age if you leave your house chances are you'd see someone with a phone in their hand, go in a house and there's computers,TVs,etc you can't leave tech now a days unless you like go in the jungle or something. That being said now that tech is so big more and more jobs are going to be about tech so later in life I would have more jobs to pick from. The biggest reason why I love tech it the fact that we're all connected even tho we don't know or see eachother in real life we can still make friends, see new things, have fun, give or find advise, anything you can imagen.</p>

<h3 id="about">What I love about Code Next</h3>
<p>Code Next is a nice little play in fruitvile. It helps you learn coding it's kindain the name but ya. The main thing for this class is for young people like me to learn more about tech and coding for the future and maybe get a job in coding but also help kids who can't learn about tech, learn about tech. I like it because there's free food,drinks,snacks,good people, they help you when you need, and more </p>

<h1> BLOG </h1>
<p id="blog">For a blog I have no idea what to do. I've never really blogged at all. It seems useless to me maybe not for everyone but it is to me. I dont know what blogging is used for to begin with.</p>
<h1> CHALLENGES </h1>
<p id="challenges">I have been through kinda a lot. I've been bullied, had no friends, broken bones, almost died, etc so I've been through a lot in life some I don't even know why but I never really let that make me down. I have a weird way of dealing with it but it works. I made most of my friends in middle school and with them I've been making most of my good memorys. I've been going out more, having fun, doing new stuff, and over all just improve myself as a person. Code Next helped me more by helping me improve myself in coding and with coding hopfully a good job. All I'm saying is that I've had bad days and others had worse but one day no matter what'll happen something good will happen small or big something is still something.</p>

<a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx">This is a link to my favorite game Rainbow six siege.</a>
<h4>I love and hate rainbow six siege because it's a really fun "team" game and is tactical "realistic" FPS(first person shooter). Rainbow six siege is a defend/attack game where a team of 5 defends while the other team of 5 attacks the OBJ(objective) it's fairly simple until you play the game and learn that you can shoot through most walls, break most walls, and the fact that you need aim plus be able to handle the recoil.The reason why I hate it so much is because it's buggy, toxic, and the devolpers (ubisoft) does some dumb things. In this game since it's realistic that means you die super fast and one way to die fast is a head shot because any weapon does differnt damages but all of them no matter how weak can one shot someone in the head. That being said why the hell would they add people with shields. One shield OP(operator) is good because it's easy to counter and he can't really fight back unless he's with a team, but why do they add someone who's the same as him but can eleticute you slowing you and damaging you. That was bad but the worse is a OP called blitz and let me tell you this I hate him with all my fiber because he's a shield that can run blocking his head and body plus he can flash you blinding you and killing you with one hit. The game also has many many other bugs like one OP that has no head. OK she has a head but it's so hard to get a headshot so people just say she doesn't have a head and for some reason ubisoft doesn't want to fix her head. Another thing that makes me kinda not like the game is the people. People are nice , annoying , bad but when you're playing video games everyone is toxic. You can see someone shot at them and your teammates walk past you at the exact moment and kill them so that's bad enough but the fact that they don't even care if it's not your fault and they vote to kick you or kill you the next round. Other than those reasons it's a soild game but I guess that goes for every game.

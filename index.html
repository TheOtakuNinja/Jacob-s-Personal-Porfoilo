<h3>A Little About Me </h3>
<p>I was born in North Carolina.I'm a little skinny Laos and Mien kid who is a freash man in oakland high school now in 2019. I love tech and you'd learn more below. I have few friends but that's all I need because I don't talk as much as others outside but inside I'm a differnt person while playing game, like yelling, talking about anything really I'm down to life telling about every bit that made me happy and everything that I hate or just made me sad. I'm a weird person but being weird made me good friends with people I'd probably never have met if I wasn't and they're one of the best people I met because I feel safe to tell them things I'd normally keep to myself</p>

<h3>What I love about tech</h3>
<p>I love tech, so much that I can barely live without it. In this day of age if you leave your house chances are you'd see someone with a phone in their hand, go in a house and there's computers,TVs,etc you can't leave tech now a days unless you like go in the jungle or something. That being said now that tech is so big more and more jobs are going to be about tech so later in life I would have more jobs to pick from. The biggest reason why I love tech it the fact that we're all connected even tho we don't know or see eachother in real life we can still make friends, see new things, have fun, give or find advise, anything you can imagen.</p>

<h3>What I love about Code Next</h3>
<p>Code Next is a nice little play in fruitvile. It helps you learn coding it's kindain the name but ya. The main thing for this class is for young people like me to learn more about tech and coding for the future and maybe get a job in coding but also help kids who can't learn about tech, learn about tech. I like it because there's free food,drinks,snacks,good people, they help you when you need, and more </p>
